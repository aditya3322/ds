## Standard Problems

### DP
how to check weather it is DP probelm or not?
* First property there will be always a choice like Y/N
* Ask will to find optimal like max, min, largest etc.
* And there will be always posibitly of recursion 

#### Knapsack 

            I1, I2, I3, I4
    Weight {W1, W2, W3, W4}
    Cost   {C1, C2, C3, C4}
    Max Bag weight - W
    Ask is Max Profit?

Knapsack problem is always of three category
1. Fractional Knapsack (Greedy) - weight can be fractional
2. 0/1 Knapsack - weight can not be fractional and it is bounded means you can take whole item
3. Unbounded knapsack - unlimited supply of items

* Subset Sum Problem
* Equal Sum problem
* Count of subset sum
* Minimum subset sum difference
* Target Sum
